## Required features

- Provide 2 http endpoints (`<host>/v1/diff/<ID>/left` and `<host>/v1/diff/<ID>/right`) that accept JSON containing base64 encoded binary data on both endpoints.
- The provided data needs to be diff-ed and the results shall be available on a third endpoint (`<host>/v1/diff/<ID>`). The results shall provide the following info in JSON format:
    - If equal return that
    - If not of equal size just return that
    - If of same size provide insight in where the diff are, actual diffs are not needed.
        - So mainly offsets + length in the data

Note, that we are not looking for ideal diffing algorithm.

Make assumptions in the implementation explicit, choices are good but need to be communicated.

Use a Version Control System (preferably Git or Mercurial). Put the source code on a public repository or send it zipped.

## Requirements

- Preferably C#. If you are really not comfortable with C#, you can use some other object-oriented and/or functional language, but provide more detailed info for running the solution
- Functionality shall be under integration tests (not full code coverage is required)
- Internal logic shall be under unit tests (not full code coverage is required)
- Documentation in code
- Short readme on usage

See the sample on next site.
